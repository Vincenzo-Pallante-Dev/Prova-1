## Hello GIT
Git branching
Inside the repo you created before:

Create a new branch called style. In this new branch:
Create a folder called css
Add a file called file style.css and inside it create this code block:
body {
 background-color: #fdfdfd;
}
Link the html file to the css. If you don't know how to do it now, don't worry. You can find it in the zip below.
Save changes.
Merge the style branch into the main branch.
